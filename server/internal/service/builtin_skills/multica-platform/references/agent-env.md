# Agent env and secrets

Contracts for `custom_env`, provider credentials and MCP server config on an
agent definition. Field semantics and the create / update commands are in
`references/agents.md`; skill binding stays there too.

`custom_env` is secret material. The CLI offers three input channels; two keep
secrets out of shell history and the process list:

```bash
multica agent create --name <name> --runtime-id <runtime-id> --custom-env-stdin --output json
multica agent create --name <name> --runtime-id <runtime-id> --custom-env-file <0600-json> --output json
```

`--custom-env-stdin` reads the JSON object from stdin; `--custom-env-file`
reads it from a file (suggested mode 0600). The third channel,
`--custom-env <json>`, puts the value on the command line where shell history
and `ps` can see it — avoid it for real secrets.

Read-side facts (these are the wrong assumptions to avoid):

- Agent resources never expose plaintext `custom_env`. `agent
  list/get/create/update` and WS events return only `has_custom_env` (bool) and
  `custom_env_key_count` (int).
- Reading plaintext values requires the dedicated `GET /api/agents/{id}/env`
  endpoint (`multica agent env get`). It is gated to the **agent's own human
  owner** or a workspace **owner/admin**, and **agent actors are denied**
  regardless of the backing member's role — a running agent cannot read another
  agent's secrets, not even one its own human owns.
- Writing values after creation does NOT go through `agent update`. The generic
  update path rejects any `custom_env` field with a 400 ("use PUT
  /api/agents/{id}/env"). Plaintext env writes are handled by
  `PUT /api/agents/{id}/env` (`multica agent env set`), which carries the same
  gate and writes an audit row.

### mcp_config

`mcp_config` is the agent's MCP server configuration (a JSON object such as
`{"mcpServers": {…}}`). It is also secret material — MCP entries routinely embed
API tokens — and offers the same three input channels as `custom_env`, on BOTH
`agent create` and `agent update`:

```bash
multica agent create --name <name> --runtime-id <runtime-id> --mcp-config-file <0600-json> --output json
multica agent update <agent-id> --mcp-config-stdin --output json
multica agent update <agent-id> --mcp-config 'null'   # clears the config
```

`--mcp-config-stdin` / `--mcp-config-file` keep the value out of shell history
and `ps`; the inline `--mcp-config <json>` does not. The CLI requires a JSON
**object** or the literal `null`; a top-level array or primitive is rejected
client-side, and empty stdin/file input errors rather than silently clearing.

Two ways `mcp_config` differs from `custom_env`:

- **It IS settable through `agent update`.** Unlike `custom_env`, `mcp_config`
  has no dedicated audited endpoint — the generic `PUT /api/agents/{id}` accepts
  it. Tri-state per the raw request body: field omitted → no change; `null` →
  clear; object → replace.
- **It is serialized on read, but redacted.** `agent get`/`list` return
  `mcp_config` only to callers allowed to view agent secrets; otherwise the
  field is `null` and `mcp_config_redacted` is `true`. Agent actors never see
  it, and a workspace may force redaction for everyone.

Provider support is not uniform: Qwen Code accepts a managed `mcp_config` through a daemon-owned 0600 temporary JSON file passed with `--mcp-config`; it is removed when the run exits. Leave the field unset (`null`) to inherit Qwen Code native settings.

#### Multica as a local MCP server

Run `multica mcp serve` on the runtime host to expose nine activity/history,
messaging and verified attachment tools. Configure command `multica`, args
`["mcp","serve"]` through the existing MCP library/assignment flow below.
Reuse existing login/task identity; never put credentials in tool arguments or
substitute the host identity. `multica mcp serve --help` describes tools, limits
and recovery. Writes may wake agents; `ambiguous_write` includes a bounded
reconciliation read and must never be blindly retried. No remote listener or
new key settings are introduced.

#### Workspace MCP servers

A workspace keeps a LIBRARY of MCP servers (workspace Settings → MCP, or
`multica workspace mcp list|add|update|remove`). Adding one there gives it to
NO agent — same shape as a workspace skill. It reaches an agent only when
someone assigns it:

```bash
multica workspace mcp list --output table        # find the server id
multica agent mcp add <agent-id> <server-id>     # give it to one agent
multica agent mcp disable <agent-id> <server-id> # stop sending it, keep the assignment
multica agent mcp remove <agent-id> <server-id>  # take it away
```

At claim time the effective set is:

| Layer | Reaches the agent when |
| --- | --- |
| runtime-local servers | always (the daemon merges the runtime's own file) |
| workspace servers | assigned to THIS agent and left enabled |
| the agent's own `mcp_config` | always; it WINS on a name collision |

Two consequences worth knowing before writing an agent's config: assigning a
shared server does not require re-listing it in `mcp_config` (they merge), and
`mcp_config` is now only about servers private to that agent — a
managed-but-empty `{}` no longer means anything about the workspace layer,
because nothing is inherited in the first place.

The stored entry is **write-only** — reads return the server's name and
transport, never urls, commands, headers, or env, for any role.
