# Repository Instructions

Multica is a task management platform where people and agents collaborate on issues. These instructions apply to all coding agents working in this repository.

## Scope and Reading Order

- Platform-specific sections below apply only to the named platform.
- Maintain shared rules here. `CLAUDE.md` files only import them. Update instructions in the same change that alters the referenced workflow or boundary; do not add incident timelines, dependency version lists, or duplicate rules.

## Sharing Rules and Package Boundaries

| Location | Responsibility and constraints |
| --- | --- |
| `server/` | Go backend; Chi, sqlc, WebSocket |
| `packages/core/` | Headless logic, API client, Query hooks, shared Zustand stores. No UI libraries, `react-dom`, `localStorage`, or `process.env`; use `StorageAdapter` for persistence. |
| `packages/ui/` | UI primitives and shared styles. No business logic or `@multica/core` imports. |
| `packages/views/` | Shared web/desktop pages and business components. No store definitions, `next/*`, or `react-router-dom`; use `NavigationAdapter`, `useNavigation()`, and `<AppLink>`. |
| `apps/web/` | Next.js routes/layouts and web-only UI. Framework APIs stay here; shared navigation adapters live in `apps/web/platform/`. |
| `apps/desktop/` | Electron and desktop-only UI/state. Application navigation goes through `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/platform/`. |

- Dependency direction is `views -> core + ui`; core and ui remain independent. Shared packages export raw TypeScript compiled by consuming apps.
- Extract logic used by both web and desktop into the appropriate shared package. Keep framework/Electron APIs in the app layer; inject platform-specific UI through props/slots.
- Wire shared features into both web routes and the desktop router or overlay. Reuse existing guards/providers such as `DashboardGuard` in `packages/views/layout/`.
- Each workspace declares its directly imported external dependencies. Use `catalog:` for shared dependencies.

## Development and Verification

Use `Makefile`, workspace `package.json` files, and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for current commands and versions. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup and worktree operations.

- Use the checkout's managed environment: `make up`, `make status`, `make down`. `make down` preserves data; `make destroy` removes the environment and its data.
- Worktrees share PostgreSQL but have isolated databases/ports. Use the environment scripts and `.env.worktree`; do not copy the main checkout's `.env` or manually create a database through an assumed PostgreSQL instance.
- Regenerate sqlc with `make sqlc` after SQL changes.
- Run the narrowest useful checks while iterating, then broaden when risk warrants it. Report what actually ran and any skipped checks.

Run these from the repository root:

| Scope | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test` |
| Go backend | `make test` |
| End-to-end | `pnpm exec playwright test` |
| Combined web/backend verification | `make check` |

## State Rules

- TanStack Query owns API/server data. Zustand owns client state such as filters, drafts, modals, and tab layout; persist only durable preferences/drafts/layout, not server data or ephemeral UI state.
- Web/desktop shared stores live in `packages/core/`. Desktop platform stores remain in desktop. Do not define stores in `packages/views/`.
- On web/desktop, workspace identity is route-driven; platform mirrors exist only for request headers, storage namespaces, and reconnects. React Context is for platform plumbing, not a second server-state store.
- Among stores, only auth/workspace stores may call `api.*` directly; other server interactions belong in queries/mutations.
- Workspace-scoped query keys include `wsId`; account-level keys remain account-scoped. Hooks needing workspace context accept `wsId` unless guaranteed to run under its provider.
- Zustand selectors return stable references; use shallow comparison for allocated objects/arrays.
- WebSocket events patch or invalidate Query caches, not server payloads in Zustand. Clearing client-owned pointers is allowed with one responder and a self-initiated guard when this client can cause the event.
- Optimistic field patches require a predictable result, rare failure, trivial rollback, and staying on the current screen. Snapshot before patching, roll back on failure, and invalidate uncertain projections on settle.
- Create/delete/leave and confirmation flows await the server before navigation or cleanup; do not optimistically delete entities. Exception: the existing workspace-leave race noted under Desktop Rules.
- Message sends use visible pending state and retry on failure.

## API Compatibility

Installed desktop clients may talk to newer backends. Preserve response compatibility at the API boundary.

- UI-consumed JSON passes through a zod schema and `parseWithFallback`, not an `as T` cast. Web/desktop use `packages/core/api/schema.ts`.
- Provide defaults for optional fields and fallbacks for unknown server enums. Prefer explicit boolean checks; avoid tying critical affordances to a single backend flag when other contract signals are available.
- When adding/changing an endpoint, update its schema and malformed-response tests.

## Database and Migration Rules

- Do not add foreign keys, cascading deletes, or cascading updates. Validate relationships and clean up dependents in application code, using a transaction when the operation must be atomic.
- Every migration-created index, including indexes on new tables, uses `CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX CONCURRENTLY`. Each concurrent index build gets its own single-statement migration file; the runner executes files outside an explicit transaction.
- Conditionally skipped migrations are still recorded in `schema_migrations`. Later DDL touching conditional objects must be idempotent (`IF EXISTS` / `IF NOT EXISTS`); document recovery if the missing object would break runtime behavior.

## Backend UUID Rules

In `server/internal/handler/`, distinguish UUID sources before using them in writes:

- UUID-or-human-readable resource params: resolve with loaders such as `loadIssueForUser`, `loadSkillForUser`, `loadAgentForUser`, or `requireDaemonRuntimeAccess`, then write using the resolved `entity.ID`.
- Pure UUID request input: `parseUUIDOrBadRequest(w, s, fieldName)`; return immediately when `ok=false`.
- Trusted sqlc/test-fixture round-trips: `parseUUID(s)`, which panics on invalid input.
- Outside handlers: `util.ParseUUID(s)` and check the error.

Workspace-scoped queries filter by `workspace_id`; membership gates access and `X-Workspace-ID` selects the workspace. Assignees are polymorphic: interpret `assignee_id` together with `assignee_type`.

## Desktop Rules

- Workspace session routes are tab destinations. Pre-workspace one-shot flows (create workspace, accept invite) use `WindowOverlay` in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/stores/window-overlay-store.ts`, not new routes. Stale workspace tabs heal by dropping stale tab groups.
- Workspace route layouts own `setCurrentWorkspace(slug, uuid)` from `@multica/core/platform`; leaving workspace context calls `setCurrentWorkspace(null, null)`.
- Cross-workspace navigation uses the adapter's `switchWorkspace(slug, targetPath)` flow; do not bypass it with direct router navigation.
- Workspace delete awaits the server. Existing workspace leave clears/navigates first to avoid the `member:removed` race; this is known debt in `packages/views/settings/components/workspace-tab.tsx`, not a pattern for new flows.
- Full-window views outside the dashboard shell mount `<DragStrip />` from `@multica/views/platform` as the first flex child. Interactive controls in the top 48px need `WebkitAppRegion: "no-drag"`.

## UI Copy

- Descriptions are optional and omitted by default. Do not restate titles, labels, values, statuses, or button actions. Add help only for a non-obvious choice, constraint, consequence, or next step; state each fact once beside the relevant control.
- Keep permissions, cost, destructive consequences, execution prerequisites, and error recovery visible when relevant. Put advanced usage and diagnostics in accessible, explicit help. Preserve labels and accessible names; do not move redundant prose wholesale into `sr-only` text.
- Review copy with its surrounding controls and both supported translations (English and Simplified Chinese). A description prop is not a requirement to write a paragraph.

## Web/Desktop UI Rules

- For Button and Dialog usage, read `packages/ui/docs/button.md` and `packages/ui/docs/dialog.md`.

- Prefer existing shadcn/Base UI primitives. Add components with `pnpm ui:add <component>`.
- Use shared semantic tokens in `packages/ui/styles/`. Typography uses the role-named `--text-*` scale in `packages/ui/styles/tokens.css`, not Tailwind's default size ramp.
- Selected states remain identifiable on hover. Handle overflow, long text, and scrolling deliberately; avoid unnecessary local state and dividers.

## Testing

- Tests live beside their implementation: shared logic in core, shared components in views, platform wiring in apps, E2E in `e2e/`, Go tests in server. Do not test shared behavior in app suites.
- Give each behavior one canonical test layer: helper tests own parsing/state matrices; component tests cover wiring, accessibility, happy paths, and named regressions. Prefer a failing regression test before behavioral fixes.
- DOM-free `.test.ts` files start with `// @vitest-environment node`; do not use it if it would silently switch the code under test to an SSR path.
- Views tests must not mock `next/*` or `react-router-dom`. Mock stores with their Zustand callable shape plus `getState`; mock API calls at `@multica/core/api`.
- E2E setup/teardown uses `TestApiClient`.
- DB-backed Go tests use `server/internal/testutil` fixtures (`dbfx.Issue`, `dbfx.Task`, `dbfx.Insert`) and `testutil.Call(h, req).Want(status).JSON(&out)`. Keep product assertions and case-specific diagnostics in the test, not fixture helpers.
- Default tests must not resolve or execute user-installed agent CLIs; pass test-created fake or missing executable paths. New default agent commands go in `scripts/agent-cli-command-names.txt`.
- Only run real-agent smoke tests when explicitly authorized. Gate them behind `agentintegration` and check `MULTICA_RUN_REAL_AGENT_SMOKE=1` before executable lookup/account access. Run the specific test: `(cd server && MULTICA_RUN_REAL_AGENT_SMOKE=1 go test -tags=agentintegration ./pkg/agent -run '<test-name>' -count=1 -v)`.

## Change and Delivery Rules

- Keep changes scoped; reuse existing patterns. Code comments are English.
- Do not add internal compatibility shims, dual writes, fallback paths, or legacy adapters unless requested. This does not relax API response compatibility above.
- New global pre-workspace routes use a single word or `/{noun}/{verb}`, not hyphenated root names. Update `server/internal/handler/reserved_slugs.json`, run `pnpm generate:reserved-slugs`, and commit `packages/core/paths/reserved-slugs.ts` when changing reserved slugs.
- Use atomic conventional commits and the repository PR template.

## 本线规矩（kun-main）

This checkout is `kun-main`: the official multica-ai/multica main plus Kun's
office changes. It is a separate line from `kun` (jeff-kunkun/multica's older
custom line) and must stay that way.

Branches
- jeff-kunkun/multica keeps two long-lived branches: `kun-main` (this line)
  and `kun`. The old `main` mirror and `release` line are gone; their last
  tips are the `archive/main` and `archive/release` tags.
- Cut task branches from `origin/kun-main`; open PRs against `kun-main`.
- Never push to, merge into, or open PRs against `kun`.
- Upstream is picked, not merged: fetch `multica-ai/multica` directly (the
  `upstream` remote), cherry-pick only the fixes this line needs onto a branch
  cut from `kun-main`, and open a PR to `kun-main`. Never merge
  `upstream/main` wholesale.
- Never change the kun-line instance or anything under `/opt/multica` on its
  host; that is the kun line.

Releases
- Server and web: merging to `kun-main` is the release. The
  `build-kun-main.yml` job in `kkunkunya/multica-image-builder` builds
  `ghcr.io/kkunkunya/multica-main-{backend,web}:sha-<sha>`, and the office instance
  deploys the tip on its own. See
  `docs/kun-main/instance.md`.
- CLI and Desktop: publish only to `kkunkunya/multica-main-release`. Never to
  `jeff-kunkun/multica` Releases or image-builder Releases — colleagues'
  clients update from those and would get kun-main builds.
- Client defaults (CLI server URL, Desktop runtime config, update feeds) point
  at the office instance and multica-main-release; keep them there.

Migrations
- Keep upstream numbering: a new migration takes the next number after the
  highest one on `origin/kun-main`, so upstream merges stay conflict-free.
- Migrations 001–585 (upstream's plus kun-main's own: password login, office
  runtime families, mirror links, project-manager Bots, plans, project sharing,
  meetings) are compressed into `001_baseline`; see `server/cmd/migrate/README.md`.
  New migrations start at 586. Do not recompress ad hoc.

Fork changes stay small: prefer a minimal patch over porting kun-line code
wholesale, and delete removed features outright instead of hiding them.

The two-way sync with the kun-line instance (`server/internal/mirror`, see
`docs/kun-main/instance.md`) can be deleted as a whole; other changes need
not accommodate it, and nothing outside it may depend on it.

Browser
- Office agents never take Kun's mouse, keyboard focus or foreground window. Web pages go through `ego-browser`
  (ego lite, one background TaskSpace per task); native windows through the `cua-driver` MCP with background input
  only. Never drive Kun's own Chrome, raise a window or move the real mouse.
  When Kun must act, `task.handOff()` (web) or move the window into his view with `set_window_frame` (native), notify
  him, and stop. The routing lives in the kun-agent-mono `browser` skill.
